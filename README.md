  ## Description
This is a backend for an e-commerce site built with Node, express, and sequelize. 

  ## Installation
  Run "npm i"
  then modify the .env.example file to be .env and enter your info. 
  then log into your mysql CLI in the folder path and 
  run "source db/schema.sql;"
  quit out of that and run
  "npm run seed"
  then run
  "npx nodemon server"
  

  ## Usage
  Since this does not have a front end you will have to use an api route testing app such as Insomnia, the routes should be something like "http://localhost:3001/api/products"
